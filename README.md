# PDF file searcher & text in PDF finder

This desktop app was made for my object oriented programming exam at [USN - Universitetet i Sørøst-Norge](https://www.usn.no).
The app was made with Java with focus on object oriented programming. It's a simple app that provides a GUI for the user to input a folder to search for PDF-files in. The user can then search for a text-string in all the found PDFs. The user can have several tabs open to simultaneously search with. 

You can test the app with PDFFinder.jar file above.
